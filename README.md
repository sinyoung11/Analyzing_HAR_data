# Analyzing_HAR_data

I analyzied UCI - HAR data with machine learning and deep learing.


I  used k nearest neighbor and dynamic time warping as machine learing.

I referred to the code below.

I  used long short term memory  as deep learing.

I referred to the code below.

You can find machine learning codes in "ml" branch and deep learning codes in "dl" branch.
